# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Github issues JS
In this task, you will be using the github api to get list of issues and display it in a pagewise manner. You will specifically be using this url for fetching issues [[https://api.github.com/repositories/1296269/issues?page=${pageNumberHere}&per_page=5 ]](https://)
By default you will start with page 1 when your app loads. 
This API returns a lot of data, your task is to only display issue names in an ordered list. 
Also display "Page number 1" on first page, and keep changing it depending on number of page. 
You will make 2 buttons, One button with id="load_next" which loads the next page of issues by calling the above mentioned API with the current page number + 1, replacing the currently displayed issues with new issues and also changing the "Page number 1" heading to "Page number 2". 
And the second button with id="load_prev", which goes back one page and displays the previous, page's issues and also changes the Page number heading.(Edge case hint:- you cannot go to Page number 0) 
Note:- Do not change the per_page parameter in URL, you only have to display 5 issues per page.
